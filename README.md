# Zundrath

this is the KMS (Key Management Service) used by any application for generating, storing and fetching symmetric encryption and decription keys

# Version : 1.2.0

Authour [@vinayakgupta29](https://www.github.com/vinayakgupta29)

#### The Key , HMAC and encrypted data are stored and sent as base64 String.

#### The Key Struct is stored after encryption in the Keystore Folder/Dir as Binary Data.

#### For the most part you don't have to edit anything in this.

## Requirements

### `Go env setup or Docker setup.`

1. <b>GO Setup</b>

```sh
 go mod download
```

```sh
go build -o ./build/kms
```

```sh
./build/kms
```

> [!TIP]
>
> For windows systems you might wanna rename the object file as `./build/kms.exe`

2. <b>Docker Setup</b>

Setup docker in your system and then clone this repository.

```sh
docker build go-kms
```

```sh
docker run -p host_port:container_port go-kms
```

> [!NOTE]
>
> The container port is defined in the Dockerfile with the `EXPOSE` command and the host port would be your machine's port which will serve the traffic
